			<p>Hey and welcome to my website! My name is Craig Fouts. I created this site as a repository for my ideas and projects. 
			I'm a recent high school graduate interested in computers, building things, and math so I thought this would be a good way 
			to bring it all together. I'm also Lead Instructor at a local Mathnasium and former Auxiliary Leader for my school's FIRST
			robotics team, but I also enjoy playing the violin, fencing, and skiing recreationally.<br><br><br>Enjoy the site, and if you have any
			questions, concerns, ideas, or anything of that nature, please visit the Contact page for my contact details.<br><br>Disclamer: 
			Some of the sight is still under construction and I'm still hashing out proportions on different screen sizes. Right now the
			site looks best on 15" and up displays but as I become more experienced in web development I will clean everything up and 
			work on scalability.</p>
