			<h1>Bertrand's Postulate</h1>

		<div class="bertrandContents">
			<p>Bertrand's Postulate was first described as a<br>
			conjecture in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand, who later<br>
			proved it for all numbers between and including 2<br>
			and 3,000,000. Because the statement was completely<br>
			proved by Pafnuty Chebyshev, in 1852, the postulate<br>
			is often also refered to as the "Bertrand-Chebyshev<br>
			Theorem" or "Chebyshev's Theorem." The theorem itself<br>
			states that for any integer "x" greater than 3, there<br>
			exists at least one prime number in between x and<br>
			2x-2. The code to the right first takes an integer<br>
			input and verifies that it is indeed an integer<br>
			greater than 3. If it is, then the program uses<br>
			the postulate to find and report all qualifying primes.</p>
