			<p>The Collatz Conjecture - also known as the "3n+1<br>
			Conjecture," "Hasse's Algorithm," "Kakutani's Problem,"<br>
			"The Syracuse Problem," and "The Thwaites Problem" -<br>
			observes an assumption made regarding sequences of<br>
			known positive integers. The conjecture states that if<br>
			the previous term is even, the term that follows it is<br>
			half the previous term. On the contrary, if the previous<br>
			term is odd, the term that follows it is 3 times the<br>
			previous term plus 1. By the rules of this conjecture,<br>
			the sequence will eventually terminate at 1, regardless<br>
			of the initial number. The code to the right outlines<br>
			this conjecture by taking some positive integer and<br>
			performing the algorithm described above with it.</P>
