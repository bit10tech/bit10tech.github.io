		<div class="aivaP1">
			<p>LEAP is an idea I am working on for a lower-arm prosthetic that learns from the user's remaining arm movements.
			I am hashing out the designs and code right now but if you'd like to see my test run with myo-electrodes please visit 
			my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0gMTF2j9M">Youtube Channel</a>. The "learning" aspect of the arm refers
			to an apparatus that is placed on the user's remaining arm that detects electrical signals in the muscles as well as
			finger movements in order to learn correspondence that can be applied in the prosthetic.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="aivaP2">
			<p>Here are a few images of the new finger design. The fingers seen on the arm linked above were taken from a small
			quadruped I had built a few months prior. These will serve to give the prosthetic a more natural look and feel.</p>
